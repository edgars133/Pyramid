## Introduction

DO INTRO
''Recent work has shown that depth estimation from a stereo pair of images can be formulated as a supervised learning task to be resolved with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, current architectures rely on patch-based Siamese networks, lacking the means to exploit context information for finding correspondence in illposed regions. To tackle this problem, we propose PSMNet, a pyramid stereo matching network consisting of two main modules: spatial pyramid pooling and 3D CNN. The spatial pyramid pooling module takes advantage of the capacity of global context information by aggregating context in different scales and locations to form a cost volume. The 3D CNN learns to regularize cost volume using stacked multiple hourglass networks in conjunction with intermediate supervision.''

TELL WHAT WE DID


```
python main.py --maxdisp 192 \
               --model stackhourglass \
               --datapath (your scene flow data folder)\
               --epochs 10 \
               --loadmodel (optional)\
               --savemodel (path for saving model)
```

```
python finetune.py --maxdisp 192 \
                   --model stackhourglass \
                   --datatype 2015 \
                   --datapath (KITTI 2015 training data folder) \
                   --epochs 300 \
                   --loadmodel (pretrained PSMNet) \
                   --savemodel (path for saving model)
```

```
python Test_img.py --loadmodel (finetuned PSMNet) --leftimg ./left.png --rightimg ./right.png

## Analysis

As a second step in our reproducibility project, it has been decided to use the Sceneflow pretrained model and finetune it on KITTI 2015, hence comparing the disparity images and find qualitative differences in the images. For the finetune, Google Colab was chosen. Since the RAM memory was limited, the batch size was reduced from 12 to 4 and the number of epochs was set to 300 epochs. Unfortunately the runtime of the VM in Google Colab is limited (12 hours) hence we managed to finetune the model for 186 epochs. Nevertheless, this was enough to get disparity images of the

## Conclusion

An interesting project
